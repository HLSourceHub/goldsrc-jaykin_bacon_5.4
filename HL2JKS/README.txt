This is actually my first time making a mod for Half-Life, so
instead of doing something structured and excellent, I decided
to just put together a bunch of shitty weapons from a bunch of
shitty games and call it a day.

All in all, it took about 4 months to do.

Beta testing was pretty much "HAY DUDZ WHO WUNTS TO PLAY????",
but the people that've been there since the start: Thearc and
Head Honcho.

The name comes from when I first released the mod to a group of
friends, I didn't know what the fuck to call it, so I called it
Half-Life 2: Just Kidding, because back then, HL2 wasn't released.

I lost the source to that and had to start over, and so I named the
new version Half-Life 2: Just Kidding: Source. But then Just Kidding
was really shit, so we changed it to Jaykin' Bacon, which also means
Just Kidding, if you're a cool person.

Etc. etc. If you want to contact me, give me an email at PODUNKIAN[AT]SUTEKI.NU
